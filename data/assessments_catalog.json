It is used in all 8.0 Job Focused Assessments (JFAs) and,. although scores for all skills are generated, only a subset of scales is reported.. These are usually scales for skills identified as important through job analysis.. The GSA measures universal skills, or patterns of workplace behavior relevant to. different job roles. The GSA can help organizations:. •. Identify the applicants with behavioral skills already suited to job roles. •. Identify incumbent strengths and growth areas. •. Redeploy talent across the business.  The GSA is not available by itself for stand-alone off the shelf use, but is available in. JFAs, for use with the Skills Development Report, and for use with a custom report.. Reports for the GSA are designed to ensure that results can be meaningfully. interpreted and understood in business contexts. The reports are designed for use. in business by managers, trained HR professionals, or participants and provide:. •. Targeted, user-friendly and professional formats. •. Clear, concise language with easy-to-understand graphical summaries. •. Insightful information to use across multiple contexts.

This. version of Scenarios (also available as a Managerial and Executive version) has been specifically. designed to assess Managerial Judgement in graduates, a group which typically has no (or very little). management experience in large organisations to draw on.

We define ‘Managerial Judgement’ as an individual’s ability to weigh up ‘real life’ managerial situations. and decide on appropriate and effective ways of handling them. Although most graduates have little. direct management experience when first recruited, employers hope that their new recruits will quickly. find their feet and become effective managers. The test predicts which graduates show the most. potential to go on and quickly pick up the skills required to manage effectively in large businesses or. organisations..  © 2018 SHL and/or its affiliates.

For Linux Operating System, the initial question bank had 26 items and 4 unique test forms. Item. analysis was carried out on a sample of 2687 candidates who had a bachelor's or master's degree. Test. forms with low reliability (<0.55) were removed. The average reliability (Cronbach alpha) of the final test. forms was 0.57 and the test form with minimum reliability had an alpha of 0.52. The final question bank. post this analysis had 25 items and 3 unique test forms that were of comparable reliability and similar in. mean and standard deviation. Where required, we do linear equating of test forms.. Normative. Information. The table below includes information regarding the mean and standard deviation of the Linux Operating. System assessment. The sample size (N) for which these estimates were taken is also included. The. following test norms have been formulated solely based on data from India. A global norm will be. established as soon as additional data becomes available.. Sample Size (N). Mean. Standard Deviation. 2034. 63.50. 21.60. Test Development. The Linux Operating System assessment was developed following the rigorous process outlined in our. Technology Hiring Multiple Choice Questionnaire Skills Tests technical manual. This process involves 4. comprehensive phases, followed by ongoing maintenance and quality assurance procedures. At a high. level, the development process includes several key steps: recruiting subject matter experts (SMEs),. collaborating with them to define the outcome or objective used for measuring and comparing test. takers, creating a test blueprint that specifies domain areas and testing outcomes within each domain,. thoroughly reviewing and editing test questions, gathering data from a representative sample of test. takers, and conducting the necessary analyses for administering the Linux Operating System skills. test. For a full description of these phases, please refer to Chapter 3 in the Technology Hiring Multiple.

    "description": "SHL 360, or the Multi-Rater Feedback System (‘MFS’), provides a holistic 360-degree view of an employee by gathering feedback from the employee’s manager, peers, direct reports, and/or other raters.  By offering a wide range of perspectives, 360 feedback gives employees a more thorough understanding of not only their strengths, weaknesses, and development opportunities, but also their impact on others.  360-degree multi-rater assessments are based on SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (“UCF”), using our proven library of research-driven competencies to provide opportunities for managers, peers, and direct reports to supply useful developmental feedback that they may not otherwise share.  SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback.  360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.",
